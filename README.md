* Data Science Intern looking for fulltime junior position ðŸŒ±

* In my free time, I am working on building my own little recommendation system. Still learning the ropes I am interested to marry content-based and collaborative-filtering methods while applying matrix factorisation. I am intrigued to explore not only the Surprise library, but also LightFM and Spark's MLlib recommendation system.
 
* On my quest to learn all data science and software engineering, I am fully immersing myself into Django and NLP Deep Learning.

* Love visualising my work in dash or streamlit and deploying it with Heroku ðŸ”­

* Surfing the wave of Bioinformatics ðŸ‘¯
