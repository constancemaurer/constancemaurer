* Currently, I am working on building my own little recommendation system. Still learning the ropes I am interested to marry content-based and collaborative-filtering methods while applying matrix factorisation. I am intrigued to explore not only the Surprise library, but also LightFM and Spark's MLlib recommendation system.
 
* On my quest to learn all data science and software engineering, I am fully immersing myself into Django. I also recently got accepted into the Machine Learning Scholarship Program for Microsoft Azure Foundational course (Udacity).
